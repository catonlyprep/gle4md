      GLE4MD aims to be a collection of tools to simplify the use of colored-noise, 
      generalized Langevin equation thermostats to enhance your molecular dynamics simulations.
      A colored-noise thermostat can be used to <a href="index.html?page=apps#optimal">enhance canonical sampling</a>,
      in particular in difficult cases such as path integral dynamics, 
      to perform constant-temperature MD in a <b>Car-Parrinello-like dynamics</b>,
      to control resonances in <b>multiple time step</b> dynamics,
      to include  <a href="index.html?page=apps#quantum">nuclear quantum effects</a> 
      at a fraction of the cost of a path-integrals simulation, 
      to compute the <a href="index.html?page=apps#piglet">particle momentum distribution</a>, 
      to selectively <a href="index.html?page=apps#delta">excite a few normal modes</a>, and a number of other
      applications which have not been invented yet.
      </p>
      <p>
      On these pages you will find a collection of ready-to-use GLE parameters,
      and a handy online tool to <a href="index.html?page=matrix">prepare the GLE section</a> 
      of the input for different programs,
      tools to analyze and fit GLE matrices, sample code to include colored-noise thermostats 
      in your MD code, tutorials and documentation to explain in detail how to 
      use colored noise in your simulation. 
      The easiest way to perform simulations using GLE thermostats with your favourite atomistic code
      uses <a href="http://ipi-code.org">i-PI</a>, a Python interface to perform classical or path integral
      molecular dynamics with ab initio (and empirical) forces, that implements all of the 
      colored-noise machinery.
