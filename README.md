Utilities to generate input parameters for Generalized Langevin Equation thermostats


This repository collects tools to fit a set of drift and diffusion matrices for a generalized
Langevin equation, typically to be used in the context of molecular dynamics to enhance sampling
efficiency, or to enforce a non-equilibrium, frequency-dependent energy distribution. 

The code is fully functional and has been used in many papers, but is not exactly well 
documented and easy to use - and unlikely to get cleaned up and documented in the near future.

If you are interested in using it, and/or to contribute to the process of making it more
accessible, please get in touch with the authors!
